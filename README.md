# Writing

This is where I upload my writings.

Writing is sharing knowledge in the most precise and permanent manner.

As a researcher, writing is the skill I must train endlessly.

In order to keep track of how I write and what I think, I will maintain this repository.

Furthermore, I hope you enjoy reading my writings.

The following are the two main categories of this repository's contents.

## Weekly Writings
I write weekly, in fact, once in two weeks. The topic of these writing are on my research interests or general insights from the research itself.


## Assignment Writings
Since I am doing some course work every semester, I end up with quite a few critiques. These are more academic writing compared to the weekly writings.


Any opinion (including criticism) on my writings are welcome!
